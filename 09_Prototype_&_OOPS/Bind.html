Detailed Breakdown

Class Definition:
A class named React is defined using the class keyword. This class has a constructor and a method called handleClick.

Constructor (constructor method):
The constructor method is called when a new instance of the class is created.

Inside the constructor:
this.library is set to the string "React".
this.server is set to the string "https://localhost:300".
An event listener is attached to a button element found in the document.

Event Listener:
document.querySelector('button') selects the first button element in the document.
.addEventListener('click', this.handleClick.bind(this)) adds a click event listener to the selected button.
this.handleClick refers to the handleClick method of the class.
.bind(this) ensures that the this keyword inside handleClick refers to the instance of the React class, not the button element itself.

handleClick Method:
This method is called whenever the button is clicked.

Inside this method:
console.log("button clicked"); logs the message "button clicked" to the console.
console.log(this.server); logs the value of this.server to the console. Since this is bound to the instance of the React class, this.server will output "https://localhost:300".

Instance Creation:
const app = new React(); creates a new instance of the React class.
When the instance is created, the constructor is executed, setting up the properties and the event listener. -->
